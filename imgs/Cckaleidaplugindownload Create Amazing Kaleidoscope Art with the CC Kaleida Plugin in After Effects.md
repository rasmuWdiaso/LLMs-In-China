1. Select the layer you want to apply the effect to.
2. Go to Effect > Stylize > CC Kaleida.
3. Adjust the effect parameters in the Effect Controls panel.

## How to Adjust the Effect Parameters
 
The CC Kaleida plugin has four main parameters that affect the appearance of your kaleidoscope:

- **Size**: This controls the size of each tile in pixels. You can increase or decrease this value to change the number of tiles in your kaleidoscope.
- **Rotation**: This controls the rotation of each tile in degrees. You can animate this parameter to create spinning or swirling effects.
- **Offset**: This controls the position of the center of the kaleidoscope relative to the layer. You can use this parameter to move or pan your kaleidoscope around.
- **Mirror Edges**: This is a checkbox that determines whether the edges of your layer are mirrored or not. If you check this option, your kaleidoscope will have a seamless appearance. If you uncheck it, your kaleidoscope will have gaps or seams at the edges.

## How to Use Masks and Blending Modes
 
One way to enhance your kaleidoscope effects is to use masks and blending modes. Masks allow you to isolate a specific area of your layer and apply the effect only to that area. Blending modes allow you to combine your kaleidoscope layer with other layers and create different color and contrast effects.
 
To use masks and blending modes, follow these steps:

1. Create a new solid layer above your original layer and apply the CC Kaleida effect to it.
2. Use the Pen tool or any other shape tool to draw a mask on your solid layer. You can also use a text layer as a mask by setting its track matte mode to Alpha Matte.
3. Set the blending mode of your solid layer to Screen, Add, Overlay, or any other mode that suits your design.
4. Adjust the effect parameters and mask properties as needed.

## How to Use Expressions
 
Another way to enhance your kaleidoscope effects is to use expressions. Expressions are snippets of code that allow you to link or control different properties of your layers. For example, you can use expressions to link the rotation of your kaleidoscope layer to the audio amplitude of a music track, or to randomize the offset of your kaleidoscope layer over time.
 
To use expressions, follow these steps:

1. Select the property you want to add an expression to, such as Rotation or Offset.
2. Hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) and click on the stopwatch icon next to the property name. This will open an expression field below the property value.
3. Type or paste your expression code in the expression field. You can find many useful expressions online or write your own using JavaScript syntax.
4. Click outside the expression field or press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) to apply the expression.
