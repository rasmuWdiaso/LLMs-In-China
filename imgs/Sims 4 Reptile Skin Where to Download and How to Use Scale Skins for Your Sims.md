# How to Add Reptile Skins and Pets to Your Sims 4 Game
 
If you love reptiles and want to spice up your Sims 4 game with some scaly friends, you might be interested in some of the amazing custom content (CC) that modders have created for this purpose. In this article, we will show you how to download and install some of the best reptile skin overlays and pet mods for your Sims 4 game.
 
## Reptile Skin Overlays
 
Reptile skin overlays are a type of CC that change the appearance of your Sims' skin, giving them scales, patterns, and colors that resemble different reptiles. They can be applied to any Sim, regardless of age or gender, and can be combined with other skin details and makeup. Reptile skin overlays are usually found in the Skin Details category in CAS.

One of the most popular reptile skin overlays is created by Crow-faced-wolf on Fur Affinity[^2^]. This mod offers 16 color variations for your Sims, ranging from green to purple, and can be used for lizard, snake, and dragon Sims. You can download it from [here](https://simfileshare.net/download/1758890/).
 
## Reptile Pets
 
If you want to add some reptile pets to your Sims 4 game, you will need two things: a terrarium mod and a reptile VFX mod. A terrarium mod is a CC object that acts as a home for your reptile pets. It usually has different sizes, shapes, and colors, and can be placed on tables or shelves. A reptile VFX mod is a CC effect that adds an animated reptile inside the terrarium. It usually has different species, colors, and sizes, and can be named and interacted with.
 
One of the best terrarium mods is created by Kaiso on Patreon[^1^]. This mod adds three new pets to your game: iguanas, geckos, and chameleons. It also comes with five new lizard terrariums, three terrarium specific furniture pieces, and seven decorative items. You can download it from [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/69444533), but you will need to be a patron to access it.
 
One of the best reptile VFX mods is created by BakieGaming on YouTube[^3^]. This mod adds three new animated reptiles to your game: a large iguana, a medium iguana, and a small iguana. They can be placed inside any terrarium and have different colors and behaviors. You can download it from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOmp4bAlVZY), but you will also need to download Bakie's Placeable Animated Effects Unlocker mod from [here](https://modthesims.info/d/634738/sn.....-for-sims.html).
