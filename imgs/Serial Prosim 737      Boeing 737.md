Serial Prosim 737 also allows you to customize your display layout, configure your hardware inputs and outputs, set up malfunctions and failures, use an instructor station, and record and replay your flights.
  
To use Serial Prosim 737, you need to purchase a non-commercial license from the Prosim Aviation Research website. The license costs â¬1250 and includes all the modules. You can also opt for an update subscription for â¬99/year to get access to the latest features and improvements. You will also need to install FSUIPC, a popular interface library for flight simulators.
  
Serial Prosim 737 is a powerful and comprehensive software suite that can enhance your flight simulator experience and make you feel like a real Boeing 737 pilot. If you are looking for a professional simulator solution for your cockpit project, Serial Prosim 737 might be the best choice for you.
  
## How to Install Serial Prosim 737
  
After you have purchased and downloaded Serial Prosim 737, you need to install it on your computer or computers. The installation process is simple and straightforward, but you need to follow some steps carefully to ensure a successful setup.
  
First, you need to decide which modules you want to run on which computer. You can run all the modules on one computer, or you can distribute them across multiple computers in a network. This depends on your hardware configuration and preferences. For example, you might want to run the Display module on a separate computer that has multiple monitors for the cockpit displays.
  
Second, you need to unzip the downloaded file into a folder on your computer. You should not put this folder within your "Program Files" directories as Windows might interfere with the program's operation. You can put it in the root of your drive or create a new folder for it.
  
Third, you need to unzip the modules you want to use into their own folders within the main folder. For example, if you want to use the System, MCP, and Display modules, you need to unzip them into folders named "Prosim737 System", "Prosim737 MCP", and "Prosim737 Display".
  
Fourth, you need to update the navigation database and terrain package for Serial Prosim 737. You can download these files from the Prosim Aviation Research website and unzip them into the "Prosim737 System" folder.
  
Fifth, you need to install the visual model and connector for your flight simulator. You can download these files from the Prosim Aviation Research website as well and unzip them into your flight simulator's folder. You need to choose the correct files depending on which flight simulator you are using: Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX), Lockheed Martinâs Prepar3D (P3D), or Laminar Researchâs X-Plane.
  
Sixth, you need to configure FSUIPC for your flight simulator. FSUIPC is a software that allows Serial Prosim 737 to communicate with your flight simulator and hardware. You need to install FSUIPC on the same computer where your flight simulator is installed and run it before launching Serial Prosim 737. You also need to assign some key commands and axis assignments in FSUIPC for Serial Prosim 737 to work properly.
  
Seventh, you need to launch Serial Prosim 737 and configure it for your cockpit setup. You need to launch each module separately and set up its options and preferences. You also need to connect each module to the System module by entering its IP address and port number. You can find these information in the System module's configuration screen.
  
Eighth, you need to test Serial Prosim 737 and make sure everything is working as expected. You can load a flight in your flight simulator and check if all the systems, avionics, and displays are functioning correctly. You can also try some malfunctions and failures and see how Serial Prosim 737 handles them.
  
Congratulations! You have successfully installed Serial Prosim 737 and are ready to enjoy a realistic and professional simulation of the Boeing 737.
