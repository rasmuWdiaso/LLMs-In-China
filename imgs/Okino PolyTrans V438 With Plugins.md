# Okino PolyTrans V438 With Plugins: A Powerful 3D Conversion Software
 
Okino PolyTrans V438 is a software that allows you to convert, optimize, and reduce 3D models from various file formats and applications. It supports a wide range of industry standard CAD (such as SolidWorks, ProE/Creo, UG NX, STEP, IGES) and DCC/Animation (such as 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema-4D, LightWave) formats, as well as VR/AR and game engines (such as glTF, FBX, U3D, X3D). With Okino PolyTrans V438, you can easily transfer your 3D data between different platforms and applications, while preserving the geometry, materials, textures, animations, and metadata.

One of the features that makes Okino PolyTrans V438 stand out is its extensive plug-in development system and API. Okino has been developing this system since 1988 and has grown to over 700 pages of documentation. The API allows third party developers and vendors to create new importers and exporters for PolyTrans, as well as system-level plug-ins that extend the main user interface. Some of the plug-in modules that are available from third party vendors are:
 
- Exporter Module for the OSG/IVE File Format (Open Scene Graph).
- Importer Module for the Alembic File Format (.abc).
- Importer Module for the ArcGIS File Format (Esri).
- Importer Module for the Blender File Format (.blend).
- Importer Module for the Fusion 360 File Format.
- Importer Module for the Houdini File Format.
- Importer Module for the OrcaFlex File Format (.yml,.sim,.owr).
- Importer Module for the PRC File Format (Adobe).
- Importer Module for the STK File Format (Satellite Tool Kit, Systems Tool Kit, MDL).
- Importer Module for the WinCaps III File Format (DENSO Robotics).

To install these plug-in modules, you need to have either a commercial or a demo version of Okino PolyTrans or NuGraf software on your machine. Then you need to download the plug-in module(s) from the links below and install them into the "vcplugin64" directory, which is contained in the home PolyTrans or NuGraf directory. Some plug-ins will have their own .exe installer, while others will be distributed in a ZIP file. Once the files have been installed into the "vcplugin64" directory, restart PolyTrans or NuGraf. The new plug-in should appear within the Okino product.

Some of the benefits of using 3D conversion software like Okino PolyTrans V438 with plugins are:

1. It enables you to work with different 3D software tools and platforms without compatibility issues. You can import and export 3D files from various sources and destinations, such as CAD applications, animation software, game engines, VR/AR devices, and 3D printers. This way, you can streamline your workflow and collaborate with other 3D professionals more easily.
2. It allows you to optimize and reduce your 3D models for better performance and quality. You can adjust the level of detail, polygon count, texture size, and other parameters of your 3D models to suit your needs and preferences. You can also apply various transformations, such as scaling, rotating, mirroring, and flipping, to your 3D models before converting them.
3. It helps you to visualize and verify your 3D designs before production. You can preview your input and output files in the Okino software interface and compare them side by side. You can also use the built-in rendering engine to create realistic images and animations of your 3D models. This way, you can check for errors, inconsistencies, or improvements in your 3D designs before finalizing them.
4. It saves you time and money by automating and simplifying the 3D conversion process. You can use the batch conversion feature to convert multiple 3D files at once with multiple threads. You can also use the command-line interface to run conversions without opening the Okino software. Moreover, you can customize and extend the Okino software functionality by creating your own plug-in modules or using third-party plug-ins.
