## Exercise 1: Basic Slap and Pop
 
The first exercise in the book introduces the basic slap and pop technique, which is the foundation of slap bass. Slapping involves striking the lower strings with the side of your thumb, while popping involves plucking the higher strings with your index or middle finger. The exercise consists of four bars of quarter notes, alternating between slapping the E string and popping the G string. The goal is to play the notes evenly and with a consistent tone and volume.
 
This exercise is useful for developing your coordination and accuracy between your thumb and fingers. It also helps you get familiar with the sound and feel of slapping and popping. You can practice this exercise with a metronome or a drum machine, starting at a slow tempo and gradually increasing the speed. You can also try to vary the dynamics, accents and rhythms of the notes to create different grooves.
