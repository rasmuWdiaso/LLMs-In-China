Fruit Ninja HD is a popular game that challenges you to slice as many fruits as you can with your mouse or finger. The game has been available for mobile devices since 2010, but now you can enjoy it on your PC with the latest version, v1.6.1, which is activated and ready to play.
 
In Fruit Ninja HD, you can choose from three different game modes: Classic, Arcade, and Zen. Each mode has its own rules and objectives, but the basic gameplay is the same: swipe your mouse or finger across the screen to cut the fruits that appear, while avoiding the bombs that will end your game. You can also earn bonus points by slicing multiple fruits in one swipe, or by slicing special fruits that have different effects.

## Tips and Tricks for Fruit Ninja HD v1.6.1 for PC Activated
 
If you want to improve your skills and score higher in Fruit Ninja HD v1.6.1 for PC Activated, here are some tips and tricks that you should know:
 
- You don't need to buy starfruit with real money. Starfruit is the main currency type in fruit ninja and you can use it to buy boosts and other swag inside the game. You can earn starfruit by completing objectives or watching video ads.
- Don't use long swipes when bombs are around. While bombs don't end the game in arcade mode, they do end the game in classic mode if you hit one. Try to always use short and brief swipes when you know bombs are floating around.
- Use Peachy Times to boost your score in arcade and zen mode. This power up gives you an extra 2 seconds for each peach sliced, which can make a huge difference in your game time and score.
- Don't use more than one finger. Using more than one finger will only obscure your view of the screen and make it harder to see the fruits and bombs.
- Try playing upside down. Playing upside down helps some players since the fruit comes up from the bottom.
- Go for combos and critical hits. A combo occurs when you slice three or more fruit in a single swiping motion, which doubles your score. A critical hit is random and gives you 10 extra points per hit.
- Watch out for bananas in arcade mode. Bananas have different effects depending on their stripes: blue stripes double your score, red stripes cause a frenzy of fruit, and frozen bananas slow down time.

With these tips and tricks, you can become a master of Fruit Ninja HD v1.6.1 for PC Activated and enjoy this fun and addictive game!
