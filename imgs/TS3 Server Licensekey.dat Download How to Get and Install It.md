A license is a file named licensekey.dat that you have to place in the root directory of your TS3 Server installation folder. The license file contains information about your organization, the number of slots you are allowed to use, and the expiration date of your license. Depending on your needs and preferences, you can apply for different types of licenses, such as Non-Profit License (NPL), Authorized TeamSpeak Host Provider (ATHP) License, or Sponsorship License.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the TS3 Server licensekey.dat file for your own TS3 Server. We will also explain how to check if your license is valid and working properly.
  
## How to Download TS3 Server Licensekey.dat File
 
The first step to get a TS3 Server licensekey.dat file is to apply for one on the official TeamSpeak website. You have to fill out a form with some details about your organization, such as name, address, email, website, and purpose of using TS3 Server. You also have to agree to the terms and conditions of the license agreement.
 
After submitting your application, you will receive an email from TeamSpeak Systems GmbH with a link to download your licensekey.dat file.

## How to Install TS3 Server Licensekey.dat File
 
The second step to get a TS3 Server licensekey.dat file is to install it on your TS3 Server installation folder. The installation process may vary depending on the operating system and the hosting provider you are using. Here are some general guidelines for installing the TS3 Server licensekey.dat file:
 
- Locate the root directory of your TS3 Server installation folder. This is where the ts3server executable file is located. For example, on Linux systems, it may be something like /home/teamspeak/teamspeak3-server\_linux-x86.
- Copy and paste the licensekey.dat file into the root directory of your TS3 Server installation folder. Make sure that the file name is exactly licensekey.dat and that there are no other files with the same name in the folder.
- Stop and restart the TS3 Server executable file. This will make the TS3 Server recognize and load the licensekey.dat file.

You should see a page with some information about your server, such as name, version, status, uptime, etc. On the top right corner of the page, you should see a green icon with a check mark and the word "Licensed". This means that your TS3 Server has a valid license.</your-server-ip>
