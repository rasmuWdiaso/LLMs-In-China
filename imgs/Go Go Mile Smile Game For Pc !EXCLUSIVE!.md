Go Go! Mile Smile is a game that has an interesting history and reception. The game was developed and published by Fuuki, a Japanese company that was founded in 1992 and mainly focused on arcade games. Fuuki was known for creating games with cute and colorful graphics, such as Asura Blade, Asura Buster, and Twinkle Star Sprites.
 
The game was released in 1995 in Japan as Susume!! Mile Smile, which means "Advance! Mile Smile". The game was also released in other regions as Go Go! Mile Smile, with some minor changes in the graphics and sounds. The game was based on an earlier arcade game called Anteater, which was released by Stern Electronics in 1982. Anteater was a game where the player controlled an anteater's tongue to eat ants and avoid enemies.
 
The reception of Go Go! Mile Smile was mixed. On one hand, the game was praised for its simple but addictive gameplay, its colorful graphics, and its upbeat music. The game was also considered to be a good example of a retro puzzle game that could appeal to anyone. On the other hand, the game was criticized for being too outdated and out of fashion for the arcade market of 1995.

The game also had a low profile and a limited distribution, which made it hard to find and play.
