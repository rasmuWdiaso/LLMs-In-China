One of the features of Kisssoft 03 2008 is the ability to perform gear optimization. This means that the software can find the optimal values for the gear parameters, such as module, number of teeth, pressure angle, profile shift, and backlash. The optimization can be based on different criteria, such as minimum weight, maximum power transmission, minimum noise, or minimum wear. Kisssoft 03 2008 can also perform sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis to evaluate the influence of variations in the input data on the output results.
 
Another feature of Kisssoft 03 2008 is the integration with other software. Kisssoft 03 2008 can import and export data from various CAD and CAE software, such as SolidWorks, Inventor, Pro/Engineer, ANSYS, and Abaqus. This allows the user to create a seamless workflow between the design and analysis stages. Kisssoft 03 2008 can also generate 3D models and 2D drawings of the gears and shafts, as well as export them to DXF or IGES formats.
