# How to Update Scx 3200 Firmware for Your Samsung Printer
 
If you own a Samsung SCX-3200 laser multifunction printer, you may want to update its firmware to improve its performance and compatibility. Firmware is programming that's written to a hardware device's non-volatile memory[^2^], which means it is saved even when the device is turned off. Updating firmware can fix bugs, add new features, or enhance security.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install the latest firmware for your Samsung SCX-3200 printer from HP's official website[^1^]. You will need a computer with an internet connection and a USB cable to connect your printer to your computer.
 
## Step 1: Download the Firmware File
 
First, you need to download the firmware file from HP's website. To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Go to [https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/samsung-scx-3200-laser-multifunction-printer-series/19135189](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/samsung-scx-3200-laser-multifunction-printer-series/19135189)
- Select your operating system (Windows or Mac) and click "Change".
- Under "Firmware", click "Download" next to the file name that matches your printer model and firmware version. For example, if your printer model is SCX-3200 and your firmware version is V3.00.01.18, you should download the file named "SCX-3200\_Series\_V3.00.01.18.zip".
- Save the file to a location on your computer where you can easily find it.

## Step 2: Extract the Firmware File
 
Next, you need to extract the firmware file from the zip archive. To do this, follow these steps:

- Locate the downloaded zip file on your computer and right-click on it.
- Select "Extract All" or "Extract Here" depending on your operating system.
- A new folder with the same name as the zip file will be created in the same location. Open this folder and you will see a file with an ".hd" extension. This is the firmware file that you need to install on your printer.

## Step 3: Install the Firmware File
 
Finally, you need to install the firmware file on your printer using a USB cable. To do this, follow these steps:

- Turn off your printer and disconnect any other cables except for the power cord.
- Connect your printer to your computer using a USB cable.
- Turn on your printer and wait for it to initialize.
- Locate the extracted firmware file on your computer and double-click on it.
- A window will pop up asking you to confirm the firmware update. Click "Yes" or "OK".
- The firmware update will start and may take several minutes to complete. Do not turn off your printer or disconnect the USB cable during this process.
- When the firmware update is done, a message will appear on your computer screen saying "Firmware Update Success". Click "OK" or "Close".
- Turn off your printer and disconnect the USB cable.
- Turn on your printer again and check if the firmware version has changed. You can do this by printing a configuration report from your printer's menu or by checking the printer properties on your computer.

Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Scx 3200 Firmware for your Samsung printer. You can now enjoy improved performance and compatibility with your device.
