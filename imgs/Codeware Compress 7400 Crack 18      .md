## 3D Pressure Vessel Design + Drawings
 
One of the advantages of using Codeware Compress 7400 18 is that it supports cross-departmental workflows. You can easily produce pressure vessel and heat exchanger drawings using the bundled Codeware Interface add-in for SOLIDWORKS and Inventor. The solid models generated by the Codeware Interface include Mates and Sheet Metal, advanced features that save time when making design changes[^1^].
 
You can also quickly create ASME Section IX welding documents from Codeware Compress designs with Shopfloor, a no extra charge add-in for Excel. And you can generate customizable spreadsheet based cost estimates with COSTER, another no extra charge add-in for Excel[^1^].
 
## Tees As Main Components
 
Another feature of Codeware Compress 7400 18 that can help you reduce pressure vessel welding and material costs is the ability to use tees as shell and nozzle components. Tees can be an excellent way to simplify the geometry and fabrication of your pressure vessels. Codeware Compress provides the option to use tees as main components and calculates the required reinforcement and MAWP according to ASME VIII[^2^].
 
## F&F Expansion Joints
 
If you need to design flanged and flued expansion joints for your pressure vessels, Codeware Compress 7400 18 can help you with that too. Flanged and flued expansion joints are used to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction in piping systems. Codeware Compress allows you to design F&F expansion joints according to ASME VIII Appendix 5 and provides detailed drawings using the Codeware Interface add-in[^2^].
