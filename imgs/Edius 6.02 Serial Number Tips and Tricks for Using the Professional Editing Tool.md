# How to Register and Activate EDIUS 6.02 with a Serial Number
 
EDIUS 6.02 is a powerful video editing software that allows you to create professional-quality videos with ease. However, to use EDIUS 6.02, you need to register and activate it with a serial number. A serial number is a unique code that is pasted on the product package or sent to you by email when you purchase EDIUS 6.02 online. The serial number is required to verify your ownership of the software and to enable all its features.
 
In this article, we will show you how to register and activate EDIUS 6.02 with a serial number in two different scenarios: online and offline.
