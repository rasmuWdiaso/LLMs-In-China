Greetings, Simmers! Many of you have been enjoying The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection, which is now available on Origin for free to those who own The Sims 2. However, some of you have encountered a problem with the game's resolution being locked at 800Ã600, which is too low for most modern screens. Don't worry, we have a solution for you! In this guide, we will show you how to change the resolution settings to match your screen's native resolution and make your game look better.

Before you start, make sure you have updated your game to the latest version on Origin. You can do this by right-clicking on the game in your library and selecting "Update Game". This will ensure that your game runs smoothly and has the latest fixes and features.

Next, you need to locate the game's configuration file, which is where the resolution settings are stored. The file is called "Graphics Rules.sgr" and it is located in the following folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\Fun with Pets\SP9\TSData\Res\Config. You can copy and paste this path into your Windows Explorer address bar to find it quickly.
  
Once you have found the file, you need to open it with a text editor such as Notepad. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with" and then choosing Notepad from the list of programs. This will allow you to edit the file and change the resolution settings.

In the file, you will see a lot of text and numbers. Don't be intimidated by them, you only need to focus on a few lines. First, you need to find the line that says "seti optionTextureMemory 32". This line tells the game how much memory to use for textures. You need to change the number 32 to match your graphics card's memory. For example, if you have a graphics card with 2 GB of memory, you need to change the number to 2048. If you have a graphics card with 4 GB of memory, you need to change the number to 4096. And so on.
  
Next, you need to find the line that says "seti optionScreenModeResolution 800 600". This line tells the game what resolution to use for the screen mode. You need to change the numbers 800 and 600 to match your screen's native resolution. For example, if your screen's native resolution is 1920Ã1080, you need to change the numbers to 1920 and 1080. If your screen's native resolution is 1366Ã768, you need to change the numbers to 1366 and 768. And so on.
  
Finally, you need to find the line that says "seti optionSimulatorResolution 800 600". This line tells the game what resolution to use for the simulator mode. You need to change the numbers 800 and 600 to match your screen's native resolution as well. For example, if your screen's native resolution is 1920Ã1080, you need to change the numbers to 1920 and 1080. If your screen's native resolution is 1366Ã768, you need to change the numbers to 1366 and 768. And so on.

Screen mode is the mode that you see when you launch the game and navigate through the menus and options. Simulator mode is the mode that you see when you play the game and control your Sims and their lives. Both modes need to have the same resolution for the game to look consistent and avoid graphical glitches.
  
After you have edited the file and changed the resolution settings, you need to save the file and close it. You can do this by clicking on "File" and then "Save" in the text editor. Then you can exit the text editor and launch the game. You should see that the game's resolution has changed to match your screen's native resolution and that the game looks much better.

You can use a different resolution than your screen's native resolution if you want to, but it is not recommended. Using a different resolution may cause the game to look stretched, distorted, or blurry. It may also affect the game's performance and stability. The best option is to use your screen's native resolution for the best visual quality and compatibility.
